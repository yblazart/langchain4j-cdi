/**
 * A CDI-aware implementation of {@link GuardrailServiceBuilderFactory} that creates {@link GuardrailService.Builder}
 * instances which resolve guardrail classes as CDI beans.
 *
 * <p>This factory is registered via the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader} mechanism and is automatically picked up by
 * {@link GuardrailService#builder(Class)} when present on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>When guardrail classes are referenced in {@code @InputGuardrails} or {@code @OutputGuardrails} annotations, the
 * resulting builder will look them up as CDI managed beans rather than instantiating them via reflection, allowing
 * guardrails to benefit from CDI injection, interceptors, and lifecycle management.
