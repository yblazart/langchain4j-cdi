# Miles of Smiles - Open Liberty MCP Example

A demonstration of an AI-powered car rental assistant using **langchain4j-cdi** on Open Liberty with **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** support.

## About

This example is based on a simplified car booking application inspired from the [Java meets AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BD1MSLbs9KE) talk from [Lize Raes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lize-raes-a8a34110/) at Devoxx Belgium 2023. The car booking company is called "Miles of Smiles" and the application exposes two AI services:

- A **chat service** to freely discuss with a customer assistant (with RAG support)
- A **fraud service** to determine if a customer is a fraudster

This example additionally demonstrates MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.9+
- Ollama running locally (or Docker/Podman)

### Option 1: Dev Mode

```bash
mvn liberty:dev
```

### Option 2: Production Mode

```

To stop: `mvn liberty:stop`

## Using the Demo

### OpenAPI UI
